We have four different plan levels to choose from, which fit many different use cases. Plans are app-based, in the same account you can have apps in different plans.

- Free
- Essentials
- Professional
- Enterprise

Deciding which plan best suits your needs will be based on features available for each plan, as well as the container sizes and usage needed for your app. You can learn more about them on the [billing page](/billing.html#billing-usage).
