<!-- Note: post logger2 release, we'll also document the environment variables
     that we set, entry point, etc.
-->

Galaxy runs your app in a set of containers using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container platform.

<h2 id="network">Network environment</h2>

<h3 id="network-incoming">Incoming connections</h3>

Galaxy runs your app containers in a firewalled network environment.  Only one port is exposed for external connections.  Galaxy tells your app what port to listen on via the `$PORT` environment variable, which contains a number such as `3000`.

Galaxy forwards HTTP connections (port 80) on your app's configured [domains](/custom-domains.html) to the port exposed for external connections. HTTPS connections (port 443) are also forwarded to this port if you've [configured encryption](/encryption.html).  You cannot serve connections on any other ports.

<h3 id="network-outgoing">Outgoing connections and IP whitelisting</h3>

When your app connects to other services like your database, those services' connections will always appear to come from one of a fixed set of IP addresses.  These IP addresses are not the IP addresses of the individual machines your container runs on, so don't be surprised if they don't match.  (These addresses are also distinct from the addresses that our "ingress" DNS address points to --- don't point your DNS at these IP addresses!)

Some services can be configured to only allow access from a list of IP addresses. For an extra layer of security, you can use these IP addresses in a "whitelist" on that service. Whitelisting is especially common for databases, and may be required by your database provider.

Note that whitelisted IP addresses are shared between all Galaxy customers, so you should still control access to your services by other means. Whitelisting is meant to protect your app from non-targeted attacks.

Add these IP addresses to your whitelist:

- For the us-east-1 cluster: 34.197.187.203, 34.197.229.75, 34.197.156.92, 34.197.222.74
- For the eu-west-1 cluster: 34.248.186.245, 34.248.14.239, 34.248.124.59
