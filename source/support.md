<h2 id="galaxy-support">Galaxy Support</h2>

You can submit support requests through our ticket platform by visiting [Galaxy support](https://support.portal.meteor.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/-1). The ticketing page is also accessible from the dropdown menu on the left within your Galaxy account.

Please note that Galaxy provides support exclusively through this platform. Visit our [pricing page](https://www.meteor.com/cloud/pricing) to see specific SLAs tailored to your app's plan.

Galaxy's support hours cover all business days (holidays excepted, see the list below) from Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM Eastern Time.

Galaxy support is dedicated to resolving Galaxy-specific issues and troubleshooting cases where Galaxy's performance may be at fault. If you surface a bug in Meteor or Galaxy that prevents deployment, or uncover a problem or performance issue with Galaxy as a whole, Galaxy support will work to resolve this.

While we strive for "best effort" with regard to non-deployment questions pertaining to Meteor, third-party packages and other topics, they are not an officially supported Galaxy subject matter area. Galaxy support does not provide code-level review.

<h2 id="enhanced-galaxy-support">Enhanced Galaxy Support Options</h2>

Galaxy customers have the option to upgrade to higher levels of paid Galaxy support for guaranteed response times as short as 15-minutes with 24x7x365 coverage, including critical cases related to application downtime or degraded performance.

Check our [Premium Support page](https://www.meteor.com/cloud) to learn more.

<h2 id="scope">Support Scope</h2>

Because of the wide surface area involved with Galaxy, a number of issues peripherally connected to Galaxy may be classified as out of scope. Questions about an app's performance, stability and implementation are separate from, and different than, supported questions targeting Galaxy's uptime, health, and general deployment capabilities.

Unsupported issues would include but are not limited to:
- a conflict between a third-party npm package and Galaxy that prevents deployment
- an out-of-date or obsolete third-party npm package
- a question centering on Meteor code or Meteor code snippets
- a DNS issue involving MX records

If you write in to support about an out of scope issue, Galaxy support will explain its status and decline to continue investigating the issue. 

Please familiarize yourself with our [Terms of Service](https://meteor.com/legal/terms-of-service) and contact support if you have further questions.

<h2 id="venues">Venues for Assistance</h2>

Every Galaxy user is also welcome to follow up on <a href="http://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/">GitHub</a> or the <a href="https://forums.meteor.com/">forums</a>. GitHub is excellent for tracking issues, while the forums are provided for community use concerning any kind of issue.

If you believe your issue is related to Meteor, you can [file a bug](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md) or add a comment to an existing bug to pursue resolution.
