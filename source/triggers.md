Galaxy's triggers automatically changes your configurations on-the-fly.

<h2 id="endpoint">Why</h2>

Triggers provide a configurable way to perform actions in your app, this is important for Professional apps that need to adapt to the demand dinamically. For example, an app to restaurants sell food online will have more accesses close to the lunch and dinner times.

> Triggers are available for all Professional apps. You can configure your triggers going to your app settings on Galaxy dashboard.
