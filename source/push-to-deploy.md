With this feature, never was easier to create an app on Galaxy. All you need to do is follow three  simple steps, then you'll have a new app deployed.

<h2 id="pre-requirements">Pre requirements</h2>

Today we have our integration just with GitHub. In the future we'll add more Git providers.

The only requirement you need today to start using this feature is to have a repository on GitHub with a Meteor project on it. And that's it.

<h2 id="deploying-a-new-app">Deploying a new app</h2>

Start by going to your Cloud account [here](https://cloud.meteor.com/). Then go to *apps* > *Deploy a new app*. Once there, you'll see this page:

Go ahead and link your GitHub account to our app, just by clicking on the GitHub button.

After connecting to your git provider you'll automatically go to second step. On the second step you need to chose your account from the git provider and then choose the repository where is the Meteor app that you want to deploy.

Now just click on *NEXT STEP* and you'll get on the third and last step.

On the last step you'll just need to configure the last details, so you can have your app deployed. Starting by the *Account* which defines to which Cloud account your app will be deployed to.

Then you get to select which *Plan*, *Container Size*, and *Region* your app will have.

On the **Deploy Options** section, you can choose which branch you'll use as your deploy branch. Every commit done on this branch will trigger a deploy. On this section you also can opt to user or not our shared [MongoDB Cluster](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteordeploy).

You also have advanced options. Here is a description of each one:

- **Meteor Settings**: You initial [app settings](https://cloud-guide.meteor.com/deploy-guide.html#settings-create) when deploying an app in a JSON format.
- **Root Directory**: Directory on your repository where the root of your Meteor app is.
- **Pre Deploy Command**: This is the command that you run to install the apps dependencies, usually being `meteor npm install --production`.
- **Deploy Arguments**: Some argument that you can provide to your [deploy command line](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteordeploy). It shouldn't be necessary for most the cases.
- **Environment Variables**: Most common when deploying a Meteor app is `DEPLOY_HOSTNAME`, that you don't need to provide anymore.

Now with all configured you just need to hit **DEPLOY APP** and the first version of your app will be deployed!

<h2 id="setup-up-existing-app">Setting up Push To Deploy for existing app</h2>

On the app page details page you can click on the button `SET UP PUSH TO DEPLOY`.

<img src="images/push-to-deploy-add-config-to-existing-app.png" style="width: 780px;">

The first two steps on this case are the same. You will just have to connect your Git Provider, and then choose the repository. For the last step you will have fewer options change. Basically all you need is to make sure everything is correct on the **Deploy Options** section. As the app is already deployed, all the other fields are already defined.

After all it's set up, you can edit it again buy clicking in button `CONFIGURE PUSH TO DEPLOY` in the app details page.

<h2 id="editing-deploy-settings">Editing next deploy settings</h2>

On Galaxy, in the app version screen, after configuring Push to Deploy to an app, you will find the field `Next Auto Deploy Settings`. Use this field to add [app settings](https://cloud-guide.meteor.com/deploy-guide.html#settings-create) for the next deploy. So when you do the commit to the branch that you configured, these are the settings that will be used.

<h2 id="push-to-deploy-price">Push to deploy pricing</h2>

Push to deploy is a paid feature, unless you're deploying a free app, in this case you'll have up to **10** deploys per month for that app.

The cost of each deploy is **DEPLOY TIME HOUR** X **TIER PRICE**.

The containers on Essentials are 0.08/h and the Professional are 0.11/h.

<h2 id="after-set-up">After set up</h2>

After you finish setting up everything, every commit you do to the chosen branch will trigger a new deploy. You can set up the same repository and branch to different apps, so you can have multiple apps being deployed just with one commit :)
