We recommend deploying your app to region(s) where your customers reside for low latency and optimal performance.

Galaxy allows you to deploy your app to the following regions:

- AWS `us-east-1` in Virginia, USA (default region)

- AWS `eu-west-1` in Dublin, Ireland

View the [deployment guide](deploy-guide.html) for specific instructions on how to deploy to the region of your choice.
