Welcome to Galaxy, the best place to host your Meteor app!

When migrating your app you'll want to deploy a new instance of your app to Galaxy, ensure it works, and then switch over DNS from your prior hosting provider to Galaxy. This way you'll minimize any disruption to your users during your app migration.
