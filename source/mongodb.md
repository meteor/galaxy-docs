description: Learn how to configure your MongoDB provider for Galaxy

Since Galaxy doesnâ€™t provide a MongoDB cluster, you will need to host one yourself. We recommend using a dedicated database hosting service such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

To configure MongoDB for your Meteor application, see the detailed steps in the [Deployment guide](/deploy-guide.html#mongo-configure).

For optimum performance, please ensure your database is running in the same region.

<h2 id="configure-oplog">Configuring Oplog Tailing</h2>

Meteor can get real time updates from MongoDB by using [oplog tailing](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver). Oplog tailing involves reading the MongoDB 'operations log' - a special Mongo collection that records all the write operations as they are applied to your database.

To use Oplog tailing, the database must be a Replica set enabled database.

<h2 id="configuration">Configuring the app settings file</h2>

MongoDB is configured using environment variables in your 'settings.json' file. Refer to the [environment variables](/environment-variables.html) section of the Help Center to find a complete example.

Note that a valid `MONGO_URL` is required unless you have removed the `mongo` package from your app. A missing/invalid `MONGO_URL` is a common cause of failed deployments.

<h2 id="authentication">Connecting to your database</h2>

Galaxy is agnostic about how you talk to MongoDB, as long as you provide the appropriate credentials. If you can't connect, follow these steps:

1. Review the settings and examples on the [Environment variables](/environment-variables.html) page
2. Try connecting without a Mongo Oplog URL to see if that is causing the issue
3. Verify the URL and username/password by connecting through a MongoDB tool or CLI

If it still isn't working, you may want to check <a href="http://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/">GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://forums.meteor.com/">forums</a>, or write to your database provider. They'll usually have more visibility into the issue than anyone in Galaxy support.
